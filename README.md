Problem Statement:  AI algorithm to predict combinational complexity/depth of signals to quickly identify timing violations. 


Timing analysis is a crucial step in the design of any complex IP/SoC. However, timing analysis reports are generated after synthesis is complete, which is a very time consuming process. This leads to overall delays in the project execution time as timing violations can require architectural refactoring.


Creating an AI algorithm to predict combinational logic depth of signals in behavioural RTL can greatly speed up this process.


The README file should cover how to generate the environment needed to run the code, how to run the code, and any other necessary information.
The document should also cover the following aspects:
The approach used to generate the algorithm.
Proof of Correctness.
Complexity Analysis.
